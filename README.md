# Spam Detection
-----------------

Spam detection is a supervised machine learning problem. This means you must provide your machine learning model with a set of examples of spam and ham messages and let it find the relevant patterns that separate the two different categories. Most email providers have their own vast data sets of labeled emails.

We are going to make use of NLTK for processing the messages, WordCloud and matplotlib for visualization and pandas for loading data, NumPy for generating random probabilities for train-test split.
